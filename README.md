## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- pip package manager
- Virtual environment (recommended)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/buildsense.git
   cd buildsense
   ```

2. Create and activate virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Data Collection & Model Training

1. Generate synthetic data (current implementation):
   ```bash
   python generate_synthetic_data.py
   ```
   This script:
   - Creates realistic synthetic data with spatial patterns
   - Simulates POI distributions based on urban planning principles
   - Generates balanced datasets for model training
   - Saves data to CSV for model training

2. Train the model:
   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   ```
   Features:
   - Automated data preprocessing
   - Feature standardization
   - Model serialization
   - Performance metrics

### Running the Application

1. Start the server:
   ```bash
   uvicorn api:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
   ```

2. Access the application:
   - Web Interface: http://127.0.0.1:8000
   - API Documentation: http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs

## üéØ Use Cases

- **Urban Planning**: Data-driven development recommendations
- **Real Estate**: Location analysis for property development
- **Business Intelligence**: Site selection for new establishments
- **City Management**: Infrastructure planning and optimization

## üîç How It Works

1. **Data Generation/Collection**:
   - **Current**: Sophisticated synthetic data generation with realistic spatial patterns
   - **Future**: Grid-based sampling of Hulhumal√© with real OpenStreetMap data
   - POI density analysis
   - Feature engineering (foot traffic, road proximity)
   - Intelligent caching system

2. **Model Training**:
   - RandomForest classifier with 100 trees
   - Feature standardization
   - Cross-validation
   - Model persistence

3. **Prediction Pipeline**:
   - **Current**: Synthetic feature generation based on location
   - **Future**: Real-time geospatial data retrieval from OpenStreetMap
   - Feature extraction
   - Model inference
   - Confidence scoring
   - Explanation generation

## üìä Performance

- **Accuracy**: High prediction accuracy on synthetic test data
- **Latency**: < 500ms response time
- **Scalability**: Efficient caching reduces API load
- **Reliability**: Robust error handling and retries

## üîÑ Extending to Real-Time Data

The current implementation uses sophisticated synthetic data generation to demonstrate the system's capabilities. To extend to real-time data:

1. Uncomment the Overpass API query code in `api.py`
2. Run `collect_real_data.py` to gather real OpenStreetMap data
3. Retrain the model with the real data
4. The application architecture is designed for this transition with minimal changes
